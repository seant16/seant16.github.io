### About me

I am a statistician and second year PhD student in Biostatistics at The Ohio State University (OSU). I graduated in May 2020 from Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio with a B.S. in Statistics.

My work experience has primarily been in the Defense, Aerospace, and Aviation sectors. Over summer 2020, I worked as a virtual Research Intern with NASA Langley Research Center in the Hypersonic and Airbreathing Propulsion Branch of the Research Directorate. I have also worked as a Statistics Intern in the Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques Center of Excellence (STAT COE) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.  These positions, particularly the one with NASA, were heavily computational so I’ve become proficient in Linux, shell scripting, Python, and R. I’ve very much enjoyed these opportunities, and I am excited to explore other areas at the intersection of computing and statistics.  

### Research interests

I have a few areas of interest that I hope to delve into here at OSU, but I have been closely reading on topics in Causal Inference and it's potential to advance statistics beyond descriptive and associational questions. I am especially receptive to methods of Bayesian inference in this area.  

One clinical application of interest is environmental epidemiology. For instance, here are two exciting areas:    
* Disease mapping over space and time.  
* Causal effects of air pollution on a regional population.
